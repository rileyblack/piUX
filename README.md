# piIX
Employed VirtualBox virtual machine to access Linux-based [Rasperry Pi Desktop](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/raspberry-pi-desktop/) C++ compiler to create custom system utilities for file management.

## Practical Take-Away Experience
*	C++
*	Virtual machines (VirtualBox)
*	Object-oriented programming, basic language constructs, classes, and data types
*	Linux manual pages and documentation
*	Linux-based Raspberry Pi Desktop system and services
*	ssh, scp, sftp
* [Rasperry Pi Desktop](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/raspberry-pi-desktop/)

## Utilities
*	mymv        Used to move and rename files ([mv](https://manpages.debian.org/stretch/coreutils/mv.1.en.html))
*	mycp   		  Used to copy files from source to destination named as parameters
*	myls   		  Used to list contents of directories and list names of other files
*	myls â€“ l   	Used to list long form of ls (name, permissions, owner, group, size, time)
*	mycat   	  Used to display contents of files named as parameters
*	myrm   		  Used to removes files named as parameters
*	mydiff  		Used to compares two files named as parameters
*	mystat		  Used to output all information of file named as parameter

Commands also support full error tracking and reporting to the user.

## Structure
This project was designed through a file manager class that encapsulates both file information pulled from the system, as well as operations that can be performed on said files. Each file manager instance handles a single file, which includes the following information:
*	Name
*	Type
*	Size
*	Owner
*	Group
*	Permissions
*	Access time
*	Modification time
*	Status change time
*	Block size
*	Children
*	Error number
